This directory contains C programs containing generic C statements which
can be used when debugging a specific C expression (e.g. Assignment, FuncDecl,
ReturnStmt, ...) containing arbitrary subexpressions. The corresponding
pickle (pkl) files contain the parsed C programs in their generic form.

For instance, a file containing:

void main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int *x = &VAR;
  printf("%p\n", x);
}

might be used for the purpose of logging to stdout all pointers to integers.
